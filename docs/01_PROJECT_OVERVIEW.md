## 🎯 Core Mission

**The Problem:**  
People know WHAT to do, but they cannot START. Or they START and get DISTRACTED.

**The Solution:**  
BroGigaChat is not a reminder app. It's a **digital brother** who:
- Eliminates friction between intent and action
- Fights procrastination like Andrew Tate's brother would
- Takes you DIRECTLY to the work, not just reminds you about it
- Forcefully intervenes when you keep skipping tasks

## 🔥 What Makes This Different

| Traditional Apps | BroGigaChat |
|------------------|-------------|
| Remind → You decide → You act | Remind → One tap → Already doing it |
| Nudge politely | Force action |
| Easy to ignore | Strict Mode takes control |
| Generic notifications | Personalized brotherhood voice |
| Just notifications | Deep-links directly to task |
