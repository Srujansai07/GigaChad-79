## STRUCTURE
```
100 Phases Ã— 100 Sub-implementations Ã— 100 Tasks = 1,000,000 Steps
```

| Level | Count | Contains |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase | 100 | 10,000 tasks each |
| Sub-implementation | 100 per phase | 100 tasks each |
| Task | 100 per sub | 21 steps each |

## ðŸ“‹ LLM IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST (Use for EVERY Task)

### Phase 1: Requirements (Steps 1-5)
- [ ] 1. Understand full requirement
- [ ] 2. List assumptions
- [ ] 3. Analyze logic & data flow
- [ ] 4. Break into sub-steps
- [ ] 5. Prepare environment/configs

### Phase 2: Implementation (Steps 6-9)
- [ ] 6. Implement clean modular code
- [ ] 7. Add comments & naming conventions
- [ ] 8. Write unit tests
- [ ] 9. Perform debugging

### Phase 3: Testing (Steps 10-15)
- [ ] 10. Run integration tests
- [ ] 11. Verify expected outputs
- [ ] 12. Ensure UI/UX usability
- [ ] 13. Optimize for performance
- [ ] 14. Check security risks
- [ ] 15. Improve code quality

### Phase 4: Finalization (Steps 16-21)
- [ ] 16. Add error handling
- [ ] 17. Document functions
- [ ] 18. Commit with version control
- [ ] 19. Build & validate
- [ ] 20. Deploy or prepare final output
- [ ] 21. Run final verification

## STRICT RULES

### âŒ FORBIDDEN
1. **NO SKIPPING** - Complete all 21 steps per task
2. **NO MULTITASKING** - One task at a time
3. **NO SHORTCUTS** - If a phase seems done, verify all 100 sub Ã— 100 tasks
4. **NO ASSUMPTIONS** - Don't assume, check

### âœ… REQUIRED
1. **UPDATE PROGRESS** - Mark complete only after step 21
2. **VERIFY EACH STEP** - Confirm completion before moving on
3. **FOLLOW 21-STEP** - Every single task goes through all 21 steps
4. **ASK PERMISSION** - Request approval for each phase/sub/task

## FOR EACH TASK, CHECK:

| Category | Actions |
|----------|---------|
| Analysis | Understand requirements completely |
| Tracking | Log progress at each step |
| Live Integrations | Ensure APIs and connections work |
| Implementation | Write clean, modular code |
| Testing | Unit tests, integration tests |
| Debugging | Fix all errors before proceeding |
| Common Errors | Check online for known issues |
| Error Fixes | Apply fixes from reliable sources |
| Live Testing | Test app after every change |
| 360Â° Code Test | Test from all angles |
| UI/UX Check | Verify usability and aesthetics |
| Functionality | Confirm all features work |
| Performance | Optimize speed and efficiency |
| Feel Optimization | Polish interactions |
| Final Verification | Complete end-to-end check |

## GOAL

Make the app reach **TOP TIER** status in:
- UI/UX
- API implementation
- Functions
- Interactions
- Loading performance
- User satisfaction (100%)
