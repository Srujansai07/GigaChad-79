# BroGigaChat - Original Raw Idea

> *Original voice transcript of the core concept*

---

## The Core Vision

Hey ChatGPT, here I got another brilliant idea. Here I want to go just simple, like to get into the working prototype, instead of making all PRT, big thing. So, like in such way, I am getting out of this complex thing and just going into the simple idea, just going to the money-based, like normal version and money-based, and main integration, main problem-solving.

So, if you see, if I have a brother, or a bro, or a best buddy, to have the same mindset, like a billion-dollar achievement mindset.

## The Problem with Regular Reminders

Hey ChatGPT, you bloody fool, you have missed my past text, ok? Just listen, ok?

The thing is, it's a reminder, **it's not just a reminder**, it's a **BroGigaChat**, which works like a **TopG Brother**, how Andrew Tate's brother works, ok?

**It's not another reminder app**, which just gives us the reminder what we have kept.

---

## Target Audience

Like it's all for:
- The creators
- The content creators
- The new generation, who want to focus
- Those who are clearly into their work
- People who want to come to the billion dollar things

---

## The Main Concept

So it's just not an app, which just reminds. If we just click on that, what we have given, like if I want to go there, some post something:

- If I go to Twitter and do some post
- If I want to do some tweet
- If I want to do some interview
- If I want to research from that paper (I have stopped at there)
- I want to read the book from there
- I want to do exercise from there

At some time, if we just keep reminder, he just takes rest, and as he is doing, or playing some game, or doing something, he thinks, *"how can we shift here to there, I am not having some interest"*.

**But this app, just by one click on the notification, it directly takes to the app, at that same position!**

---

## The Three Stages

### Stage 1: Automation

Just automation, if I want to say, just say, like take the all top apps, what they generally do. If he said those things, like I want to post a thing, I want to do some tweet on this topic:

- He directly takes, **not takes to Twitter, but he takes to that post**, that specific thing, what he want to do
- So that he directly goes to the correct point
- He don't deviate by opening Instagram, opening YouTube, seeing this, exploring, unnecessary stuff
- He directly goes to the main thing, and completes it, and comes back

**That's the main thing!** This is the thing, which works as a bro, instead of just having such bloody things, like going some scrolling, time wasting time, he is a real manager.

If I am the information, and having the right knowledge, and everything, **he is my bro, which manages, and enhances my productivity**.

### Stage 2: AI + Automation (Basic Subscription)

This is the second stage, the subscription.

Many, half of the users, don't need this AI thing. But who want, just like by using our app, they should feel to use AI.

Examples:
- Posting a YouTube something video - it doesn't need AI because it's just automation, opening the thing, and keeping the direct text
- But for enhancement, like Twitter post, and dating, and mentioning, it needs some AI recommendations

### Stage 3: Ultimate Subscription (AI + Automation + Enhancement)

This is the thing, which takes to:
- The direct correct phase
- Correct phase automation
- AI recommendations
- Enhancement which says to do like this, post like this, do this work like this, read from here
- Also extra information, you go there

It's an enhanced thing. So these are three stages I want to build.

## The Street Mode (Stage 2 Killer Feature)

So, if you see, we can lure more people just by the **street mode** in the second stage, where it's directly without clicking.

### The Notification Flow

When we get the notification about how the reply pops down at a small dynamic island:

1. **First Notification**: Extend for 10 minutes, extend for half an hour - we can extend up to two, three times
2. **Second Stage**: If we just keep extending, like "I'm daily skipping my workout"...
3. **Third Skip - STRICT MODE**: It will directly kick you off!

### What Strict Mode Does

It directly:
- Opens the app, or YouTube, or songs, or playlist
- Plays the song as you recommended
- As your daily routine, or as your workout video
- Clears everything from the recent
- Removes distractions

And goes directly, say him to: **"You should do focus!"**

Like a brotherhood, who strictly encourages me, and focus on my health, and my condition.

---

## The Brotherhood Feel

He directly works as a real TopG brotherhood, so that he directly removes the thing, he directly takes you to the app, removing, clearing all the things from the recent, and keep, so that he should do, he will do.

Like, he just feels as a brother: **"Thank you brother!"**

---

## The Third Skip Ultimate Mode

If we didn't terminate, it will directly do that thing.

Like, if you are extending, if you are seeing the reels, like, bloody reels, for one hour:

- After 10 minutes, you will skip it
- After 20 minutes, again, you will skip it
- At the third skip, it will directly:
  - Remove the Instagram from the home and recent
  - Take you to the gym section, or the music section
  - Directly says you to: **"DO IT! DO IT!"**

---

## Target Generation

Mainly focus on this: We want to target the generation who are alone, and who wants a simple push.

Not everyone has everyone, everywhere around them. So that the simple push, just think, the students and everyone are thinking to become an innovator, or something, push everything.

Just to corely focus on the idea, simple, this simple solving idea, so that it can directly influence the many other people.

And we can directly focus the main thing: **subscription**, so that he can feel the real brotherhood, and he can just go to his work on a concentrated way.

---

## The Flow Summary

As it is automation app, there won't be any reply pop-up when we get notification:

1. **First notification**: Just extend and go
2. **Middle notification**: Extend
3. **Last notification**: TERMINATE (takes you directly to the task)

## Integration with Existing Assistants

You know, these things, like how these assistants, like Google Assistant, and Google Gemini, having those new features, like going to that directly, and doing. So it just takes to the app, but which don't listen our concern on such thing, also, we should manually open the app.

So, that's why, integrating this manual reminder to the **live actions**, and the **bro push thing**, which helps us for the real motivation.

This push thing in the second stage - **the main implementation for the second stage.**
